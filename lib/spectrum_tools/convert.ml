  What we call "ansi256" here are the xterm 256 color palette
  i.e. colours set by using the ESC[38;5;<code>m sequence

  The palette is organised such that:

    0-15: the basic 'system' colours, RGB values of 0, 128, 255
      plus an extra grey of 192,192,192
    16-231: non-grey colours, RGB values of 0, 95, 135, 175, 215, 255
      so intervals of 40 with darkest interval missing and all offset +15
    232-255: greys in intervals of 10, offset and truncated to 8..238

  The non-grey colours are organised into 'rows', with the six values of
  the B component as columns - the rows start with R:0 and G:0,
  incrementing G for the current R before incrementing R.
  starting at 16: 0,0,0

  The 16 basic colours are organised as:
    0: 0,0,0
    1-6: combinations of 0,128
    7: 192,192,192
    8: 128,128,128
    9-14: combinations of 0,255 (symmetrical to 1-6)
    15: 255,255,255

  NOTE: there are no 128+255 combinations, only 0+128 and 0+255

  (RGB values according to https://www.ditig.com/256-colors-cheat-sheet)

  but terminals are configurable and Wikipedia shows different apps
  choose different defaults for the 16 colour base palette:

    their method uses HSV, which is similar to HSL
    in HSL, L is "lightness" and max L means white
    in HSV, V is "value" and it interacts with saturation so that:
    - max S, max V == max S, 0.5 L (in HSL) i.e. fully saturated bright colour
    - min S, max V == white
    - min V == black

    so `let value = saturation` is a bit odd, but in the usual case they
    will rgb -> hsv and take the V

    V is a 0..100 scale

    this is using a different escape code to the xterm256 ones:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit
    but the colours are the same as codes 0..15 in the 256 palette

    there are two ranges 30..37 and 90..97
    being the std and bright colours respectively
    code 30 == black

    these are 'foreground' codes

  This sticks closely to the Chalk.js algorithm but has a more accurate
  mapping to the ANSI palette by:
  - grey-like colour detection by avg intensity rather than bit shift buckets
  - non-grey-like colours quantized to their actual nearest ANSI target
    (though again colours in the 1-16 basic range are not used as targets)

  This may be marginally slower than the original but is still pretty simple.

  The [Improved] converter above should return numerically closest match.

  However when researching palette quantization we find that there are
  some algorithms that aim to provide 'perceptually' closest matches.

  The key one is to compare colours via their Euclidian distance in the
  LAB colour space. So for this converter we first find all the likely
  target candidates in the ANSI palette, then return the closest measured
  via that method.
